### 🚩 Why We Build
Two developers challenging the status quo:
- 📉 **No more bloat** - 8GB RAM for 10 players? Never again
- 🧩 **Modern API** - 10 lines instead of 100 for basic features
- 🏗️ **Clean core** - Modular design over legacy monoliths

### 🔥 Core Design
- 🚀 **Speed First**  
  Rewriting chunk/entity systems from scratch
